# Week 6 Assignments: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Dataset 1: Indian Cars - Data Analysis and Visualization

### Overview
Around 3.34 Lakh passenger cars were sold in the Indian market in May 2023. The sales increased by over 13% when compared to May last year. The Top 25 Selling Cars constituted over 75% of the cars sold in April 2023.

### Steps for Univariate Analysis
1. **Understand Dataset:**
   - Get a sense of the dataset structure, including the number of rows and columns.
2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing values, if any.
3. **Data Types:**
   - Check the data types of each column.
4. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Calculate basic descriptive statistics for numeric columns.
5. **Histograms:**
   - Visualize the distribution of key numeric variables (e.g., sales, price).
6. **Bar Charts:**
   - Represent the count of categorical variables (e.g., car models, manufacturers).
7. **Box Plots:**
   - Identify outliers and understand the distribution of numeric variables.
8. **Pie Charts:**
   - Represent the contribution of different car models or manufacturers.
9. **Count Plots:**
   - Visualize the count of observations for categorical variables.

### Steps for Bivariate Analysis
1. **Correlation Matrix:**
   - Understand relationships between numeric variables.
2. **Scatter Plots:**
   - Explore the relationship between two numeric variables.
3. **Pair Plots:**
   - Overview of relationships between multiple numeric variables.
4. **Bar Charts with Hue:**
   - Enhance bar charts by introducing the 'hue' parameter.
5. **Heatmaps:**
   - Visualize the correlation matrix for better insights.
6. **Joint Plots:**
   - Display the distribution of two numeric variables and their relationship.
7. **Box Plots with Hue:**
   - Enhance box plots by introducing the 'hue' parameter.
8. **Categorical Plots:**
   - Explore relationships between categorical and numeric variables.
9. **Violin Plots:**
   - Visualize the distribution of numeric variables across different categories.
10. **Stacked Bar Charts:**
   - Represent the combined contribution of different categories.

### Insights and Documentation
